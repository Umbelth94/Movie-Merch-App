# Movie Merch

## Description

This app allows you to search for movies, display information about them, and show the trailer for the movie if it exists.

- We wanted something that would aggregate the information for our favorite movies into one single location.
- Making this app felt like the right choice given something like this doesn't exactly exist in the way we wanted.
- This app consolidates the information into one easy to use location

## Usage

When on the main page, you can search for movies via the search bar, and you can select previously selected movies from the dropdown list above the search bar. Movies will only be saved to local storage after you click on search result you want. Information about the movie will only be displayed when you click on the movie you want.
